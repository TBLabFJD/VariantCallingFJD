The calls made by GenotypeGVCFs and HaplotypeCaller run in multisample mode should mostly be equivalent, especially as cohort sizes increase. However, there can be some marginal differences in borderline calls, i.e. low-quality variant sites, in particular for small cohorts with low coverage. For such cases, joint genotyping directly with HaplotypeCaller and/or using the new quality score model with GenotypeGVCFs (turned on with -new-qual) may be preferable.

    -R ref/ref.fasta \
    -I bams/mother.bam \
    -I bams/father.bam \
    -I bams/son.bam \
    -O sandbox/trio_hcjoint_nq.vcf \
    -L 20:10,000,000-10,200,000 \
    -new-qual \
    -bamout sandbox/trio_hcjoint_nq.bam
In the interest of time, we do not run the above command. Note the BAMOUT will contain reassembled reads for all the input samples.
