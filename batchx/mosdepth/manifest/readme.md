Calculates BAM coverage for QC (in SNP and CNV) and internal MAF database using [`mosdepth`](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth).


# Context

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) coverage describes the average number of reads that align to, or "cover," known reference bases. The sequencing coverage level often determines whether variant discovery can be made with a certain degree of confidence at particular base positions.
